# Collection object

#### Description

Like an array, a collection associates a set of objects or values as a logical group and provides access to them by index. However, most collection objects are read-only. You do not assign objects to them yourselfâ€”their contents update automatically as objects are created or deleted.

?> **Note:** The index numbering of a collection starts with 1, not 0.

## Objects

- [ItemCollection object](../items/itemcollection.md) All of the items (imported files, folders, solids, and so on) found in the Project panel.
- [LayerCollection object](../layers/layercollection.md) All of the layers in a composition.
- [OMCollection object](../renderqueue/omcollection.md) All of the Output Module items in the project.
- [RQItemCollection object](../renderqueue/rqitemcollection.md) All of the render-queue items in the project.

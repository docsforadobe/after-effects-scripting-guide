## Attributes

### LightLayer.lightSource:

`app.project.item(index).layer(index).lightSource`

!!! note
    `LightLayer.lightSource` was added in After Effects 24.3, but allowed only HDR and EXR layers as sources.

    In After Effects (Beta) 25.2.0.098, it was updated to allow any 2D layer type as a source.

#### Description

For a light layer, the layer to use as a light source when `LightLayer.lightType` is `LightType.ENVIRONMENT`.

`LightLayer.lightSource` can be any 2D video, still, or pre-composition layer in the same composition. Attempting to assign a 3D layer as the `.lightSource` will result in an "Invalid light source specified" error.

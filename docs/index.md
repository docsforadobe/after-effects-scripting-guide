# After Effects Scripting Guide

This repo hosts the After Effects Scripting Guide community docs.

This initially came from the Adobe After Effects CS6 Scripting Guide, and has been added to and adjusted to reflect the current state of scripting within AE.

## Navigating the Guide

If you're not sure where to start, take a look at the [Overview](./introduction/overview.md) for how scripting works in After Effects, or [Changelog](./introduction/changelog.md) for updates to the scripting API over time.

## Contribution

This endeavour is primarily community-supported & run; contributors are welcome and encouraged to suggest fixes, adjustments, notes/warnings, and anything else that may help the project.

For specific information on how to contribute & best practices, see the [Documentation Contribution Guide](https://docsforadobe.dev/contributing/contribution-guide/).
